ad-402 is a project that combines frontend widgets, crypto payments, and dynamic ad serving.

## High-Level Architecture

**Frontend Widget** → **Payment Gateway (X402)** → **Backend API** → **Database** → **Ad Serving**

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Frontend Widget (Embeddable Script)

You'll need to create a JavaScript widget that websites can embed:

```html
<!-- Website owners add this to their site -->
<script src="https://yourdomain.com/ad-widget.js" 
        data-api-key="website-api-key" 
        data-position="banner">
</script>
<div id="ad-container"></div>
```

The widget should:
- Check if an ad is currently active for this website
- Display the ad OR show the "Purchase this ad in 1 min" button
- Handle the iframe popup for payments
- Refresh ad content based on expiration times

### 2. Payment Flow with X402

For the crypto payment integration:
- Use X402 protocol for micropayments
- Support popular crypto addresses (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- Query crypto addresses either from the website's API key config or your API

### 3. Backend Components

**API Endpoints needed:**
- `GET /api/ad-status/:websiteId` - Check current ad status
- `POST /api/purchase-ad` - Initiate ad purchase
- `POST /api/confirm-payment` - Confirm crypto payment
- `PUT /api/ads/:adId` - Update ad content
- `GET /api/serve-ad/:websiteId` - Serve current active ad

**Database Schema:**
```sql
websites (id, api_key, crypto_address, domain)
ads (id, website_id, image_url, link_url, start_time, end_time, paid_amount)
payments (id, ad_id, crypto_tx_hash, amount, status)
```

### 4. Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Real-time Ad Updates:**
- Use WebSocket connections or Server-Sent Events
- Implement efficient caching with TTL based on ad expiration
- Consider using Redis for fast ad serving

**Crypto Payment Verification:**
- Monitor blockchain for payment confirmations
- Use webhook systems for payment status updates
- Implement timeout mechanisms for unpaid ads

**Security:**
- Validate API keys and domains
- Prevent XSS attacks in the embedded widget
- Rate limiting for API calls
